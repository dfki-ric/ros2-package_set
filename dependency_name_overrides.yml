# In case a dependency of a package with autogenerated package.xml does not fit a pre-defined 
# package name in a existing package.xml of the dependency, you can define the correct dependency name here
# 
# e.g. slam3d comes with a manifest.xml and package.xml. In the package.xml the package name is just "slam3d".
# In packages with juts a manifest.xml, the generation whould produce a dependency converted from the
# path "slam/slam3d" -> "slam-slam3d" as name for the dependency, but the manually written package.xml
# there defines just "slam3d".
# To have the manually set package name occur in auto-generated package.xml files, you can define the 
# name conversion from path to the manula package name here:
slam/slam3d: slam3d
